@17  = ~Journey to the Windspear Hills.

I was approached by a Lord Jierdan Firkraag, whose lands outside of Athkatla are being plagued by ogre bandits.  He has asked that I journey to the Windspear Hills and kill these ogres, and has offered a 10,000 gp reward for the deed.~
@19  = ~I have no doubt your service will be exemplary. If all goes well, we shall all receive exactly what we deserve. You seem to already know the location of my lands; go- the Windspear Hills await.~
