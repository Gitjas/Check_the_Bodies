@1   = ~Are ye well, lass?~
@2   = ~Right then.~
@3   = ~How are ye now?~
@4   = ~Good.  I shall cast more lightning at thee.  Gather and hold it as long as ye can.  If it starts to hurt thee, or ye feel it trying to burst out and ye cannot stop it, fair enough.~
@5   = ~Let it flow out at the sky or at the rock you struck earlier.  Do not release it until then, so that I may roughly learn thy capacity.  We have healing near at hand.  Be not afraid.~
