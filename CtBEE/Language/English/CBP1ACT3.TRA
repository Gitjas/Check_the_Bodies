@1   = ~That is because Mourngrym and Shaerl figured you'd spend far more time here.~
@2   = ~I suspect that someone must have told them.~
@3   = ~Just like a cavern.  You'll get used to it...or you could light the night-lamp just within the door.  Only mind you, put it out when you leave, or the room will be a smoke-hole the next time you use it.~
@4   = ~Do you have plans for the day, you two?~
@5   = ~Well, it is usual to see the dale, your first full day, and hunt or ride the countryside after high sun, with gaming and talk in the evening... But I'd advise a far less interesting alternative, if I may, until after the testing this evening.~
@6   = ~If you don't mind, Illistyl and I will bring your meals.  You stay here in this room until tonight.  Any of the Knights will come to see you, or you could spend the day together, just the two of you...~
@7   = ~Eight men tried to get into the Tower of Ashaba last night, using magic.  They were sent by the High Impeceptor of Bane, and they were after you, Shandril.  They were to capture you for your power to wield spellfire.  They were all slain, or are all dead now.~
@8   = ~They might well have succeeded except for Torm and Rathan, who were out on an extra patrol requested by Mourngrym, and Sharantyr, who went for a walk, unarmed, to clear her head.~
@9   = ~How will you stop them hunting you out?~
