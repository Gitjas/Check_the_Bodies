@1   = ~(If such a thing 
As courage dwell in men, ye heavenly powers, 
Now double all that virtue in my tongue.)~
@2   = ~Yes; how d'ee, sister?~
@3   = ~Let me entreat you, leave us a while, Putana.  Sister,
I would private with you.~
@4   = ~Come, sister, lend your hand, let's walk together.
I hope you need not blush to walk with me;
Here's none but you and I.~
@5   = ~Faith, I mean no harm.~
@6   = ~No, good faith; how is't with 'ee?~
@7   = ~Trust me, but I am sick, I fear so sick,
'Twill cost my life.~
@8   = ~I think you love me, sister.~
@9   = ~I know't indeed.--Y'are very fair.~
@10  = ~That's as it proves.  The poets feign, I read,
That Sune for her forehead did exceed
All other godddesses: but I durst swear
Your forehead exceeds hers, as hers did theirs.~
@11  = ~Such a pair of stars
As are thine eyes would, like Lathander's fire,
If gently glanced, give life to senseless stones.~
@12  = ~The lily and the rose, most sweetly strange,
Upon your dimpled cheeks do strive for change.
Such lips would tempt a saint; such hands as those
Would make an anchorite lascivious.~
@13  = ~If you would see a beauty more exact
Than art can counterfeit or nature frame,
Look in your glass and there behold your own.~
@14  = ~Here.  My dagger.~
@15  = ~And here's my breast, strike home.
Rip up my bosom, there thou shalt behold
A heart in which is writ the truth I speak.
Why stand 'ee?~
@16  = ~Yes, most earnest.
You cannot love?~
@17  = ~Me.  My tortured soul
Hath felt affliction in the heat of death.
O Annabella, I am quite undone.
The love of thee, my sister, and the view
Of thy immortal beauty hath untuned
All harmony both of my rest and life.
Why d'ee not strike?~
@18  = ~True, Annabella; tis no time to jest.
I have too long suppressed the hidden flames
That almost have consumed me; I have spent
Many a silent night in sighs and groans,
Ran over all my thoughts, despised my fate,
Reasoned against the reasons of my love,
Done all that smoothed-cheek virtue could advise,
But found all bootless: 'tis my destiny
That you must either love, or I must die.~
@19  = ~Let some mischief 
Befall me soon, if I dissemble aught.~
@20  = ~You
My sister Annabella....
I have asked counsel of the holy church
Who tells me I may love you, and 'tis just
That since I may, I should; and will, yes, will.
Must I now live, or die?~
@21  = ~Let not this music be a dream, ye gods,
For pity's sake, I beg 'ee.~
@22  = ~On my knees
Sister, even by my mother's dust, I charge you,
Do not betray me to your mirth or hate,
Love me, or kill me, sister.~
@23  = ~In good troth I do,
And so do you, I hope: say, I'm in earnest.~
@24  = ~And I, and by this kiss,
(Once more, yet once more; now let's rise by this.

I would not change this minute for Elysium.
What must we now do?~
@25  = ~Come then,
After so many tears as we have wept,
Let's learn to court in smiles, to kiss, and sleep.~
@26  = ~Come Annabella: no more sister now,
But love, a name more gracious; do not blush,
Beauty's sweet wonder, but be proud to know
That yielding thou hast conquered, and inflamed
A heart whose tribute is thy brother's life.~
@27  = ~I marvel why the chaster of your sex
Should think this pretty toy called maidenhead
So strange a loss, when, being lost, 'tis nothing,
And you are still the same.~
@28  = ~Music as well consists
In th' ear as in the playing.~
@29  = ~Thou wilt chide me then.
Kiss me:--so.  Thus hung Ao on Sune's neck,
And sucked divine ambrosia from her lips.
I envy not the mightiest man alive,
But hold myself in being king of thee
More great than were I king of all the world.
But I shall lose you, sweetheart.~
@30  = ~You must be married, mistress.~
@31  = ~Someone must have you.~
@32  = ~Nay, some other.~
@33  = ~What, you will not?
But tell me, sweet, canst thou be dared to swear
That thou wilt live to me, and to no other?~
@34  = ~Enough, I take thy word.  Sweet, we must part.  
Remember what thou vowst; keep well my heart.~
@35  = ~I must.~
@36  = ~Soon.~
@37  = ~Farewell.~
@38  = ~What of her?  For Heaven's sake, speak; how does she?~
@39  = ~She is not dead, ha?  Is she?~
@40  = ~With child?  How dost thou know't?~
@41  = ~But in what case is she?~
@42  = ~Commend me to her, bid her take no care;
Let not the doctor visit her, I charge you,
Make some excuse, till I return.--O me!
I have a world of business in my head.--
Do not discomfort her.--
How does this news perplex me!--If my father
Come to her, tell him she's recovered well,
Say 'twas but some ill diet; d'ee hear, woman?
Look you to't.~
