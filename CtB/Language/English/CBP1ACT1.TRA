@1   = ~Ah, you're awake at last.  Not feeling ill, I hope.~
@2   = ~How romantic, I must say, my lord.  Morningfeast is an ask-in-the-great-hall affair that lasts until highsun.  The chamberpot is under there if you must, but behind that door over there is a water-bain, that all the ladies here have in their chambers.  Was there not one in your room?~
@3   = ~Oh?  And how came they by that idea?~
@4   = ~No.  Why do you ask?~
@5   = ~Say on.~
@6   = ~Nor from mine.  Only, why?~
@7   = ~Yes.~
@8   = ~Well enough.  I feel weary, a little, but not sick or strange.~
