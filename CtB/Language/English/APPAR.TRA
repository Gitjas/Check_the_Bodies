@1   = ~Greetings adventurers.  So many of you have come down to loot these ancient basements, yet none ever return.  Adventurers are not known for their wisdom, otherwise they'd have chosen a safer profession.  Take the five people that stand behind me, forever frozen in stone.  Each one of these foolish men and women came to find treasure.  Now they stand vigil over the bestiary.  Most of the other creatures have long disintegrated to dust, but the great wyrm known as Mechezarin still hangs in its original repose of death.  Breathtaking, isn't he?~
@2   = ~If you travel further into the room you will find the only living creatures that remain within the bestiary.  These winged beasts have lived for centuries, augmented by ancient and powerful magics.  None so far have been able to defeat them.  However, if you wish to defeat the terrible beasts, there is help available to you.  Each of the statues behind me houses the cursed body of some poor hero.  By depressing the button at the base of each statue, you will release the ancient hero.  The hero is enspelled to serve you for a short time, but after that time has run out he'll take his revenge on he who dared command him.  There's nothing more for me to say.  Goodbye now.~
